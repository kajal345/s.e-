DML

The DML commands in Structured Query Language change the data present in the SQL database.
We can easily access, store, modify, update and delete the existing records from the database using DML commands.
dml commands are:

SELECT Command
INSERT Command
UPDATE Command
DELETE Command

1)SELECT is the most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language. 
The SELECT command shows the records of the specified table. 
It also shows the particular record of a particular column by using the WHERE clause.
SELECT column_Name_1, column_Name_2, ….., column_Name_n ..FROM Name_of_table;  
column_Name_1, column_Name_2, ….., column_Name_N are the names of those columns whose data we want to retrieve from the table.
If we want to retrieve the data from all the columns of the table,we have to use select command.

for example i want to know students who get  50 marks out of 100..so there i can use select command.
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Stu_Marks = 50;
