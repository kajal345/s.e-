DML

The DML commands in Structured Query Language change the data present in the SQL database.
We can easily access, store, modify, update and delete the existing records from the database using DML commands.
dml commands are:

SELECT Command
INSERT Command
UPDATE Command
DELETE Command

1)SELECT is the most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language. 
The SELECT command shows the records of the specified table. 
It also shows the particular record of a particular column by using the WHERE clause.
SELECT column_Name_1, column_Name_2, ….., column_Name_n ..FROM Name_of_table;  
column_Name_1, column_Name_2, ….., column_Name_N are the names of those columns whose data we want to retrieve from the table.
If we want to retrieve the data from all the columns of the table,we have to use select command.

for example i want to know students who get  50 marks out of 100..so there i can use select command.
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Stu_Marks = 50;  


2)insert command
INSERT is another most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language, 
which allows users to insert data in database tables.

INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME ( column_Name1 , column_Name2 , column_Name3 , .... column_NameN )  VALUES (value_1, value_2, value_3, .... value_N ) ; 
where table name:table name in which you want to insert data
column name->table's column name
values->value you want to insert

INSERT INTO Student (Stu_id, Stu_Name, Stu_Marks, Stu_Age) VALUES (2, kajal, 50, 23);  

UPDATE DML Command
UPDATE is another most important data manipulation command in Structured Query Language, which allows users to update or modify the existing data in database tables.


UPDATE Table_name SET [column_name1= value_1, ….., column_nameN = value_N] WHERE CONDITION;  
Here, 'UPDATE', 'SET', and 'WHERE' are the SQL keywords, and 'Table_name' is the name of the table whose values you want to update.
Suppose, you want to update Stu_Marks and Stu_Age of that student whose Stu_Id is 114 and 202. To do this, you have to write the following DML Update command:


UPDATE Student SET Stu_Marks = 50, Stu_Age = 22 WHERE Stu_Id = 114 AND Stu_Id = 202;
