Primary key is a value which is unique for every record in the table
for example..in your school or college you have your unique roll no and enrollment no.
because in school,there is  a some students who have same name and same mobile no.or else
but our roll no is always unique.
Each table in database must have one primary key.
primary key is autoincrement means we dnt need to add data in primary key coumn because it is automatically increased
for example if my primary key is start with 1 then it will be automatically increased by 2 3 4...
primary key has no duplicate data.it is always unique
ex.
Each employee has a unique personal number, company code, etc.
each country has unique name and pincode number
