A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

for example we have two table one is student and other is faculty..if we want to know which student is taking class perticular from which faculty,,then we can join two tables.

there is a types of join

1)inner join

The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition is satisfied. T
his keyword will create the result-set by combining all rows from both the tables where the condition satisfies i.e value of the common field will be the same. 

for example we want to know which student enroll in which course we can use inner join query for that
SELECT StudentCourse.COURSE_ID, Student.NAME, Student.AGE FROM Student
INNER JOIN StudentCourse
ON Student.ROLL_NO = StudentCourse.ROLL_NO;


left join:
This join returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matches rows for the table on the right side of the join. 
For the rows for which there is no matching row on the right side, the result-set will contain null. LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN.

SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

for example

SELECT Student.NAME,StudentCourse.COURSE_ID 
FROM Student
left JOIN StudentCourse 
ON StudentCourse.ROLL_NO = Student.ROLL_NO;


right join

RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN. This join returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the join and matching rows for the table on the left side of the join. For the rows for which there is no matching row on the left side, 
the result-set will contain null. RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN. 


SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

SELECT Student.NAME,StudentCourse.COURSE_ID 
FROM Student
RIGHT JOIN StudentCourse 
ON StudentCourse.ROLL_NO = Student.ROLL_NO;


fULL JOIN creates the result-set by combining results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. 
The result-set will contain all the rows from both tables.
For the rows for which there is no matching, the result-set will contain NULL values.


SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1 
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

for example

SELECT Student.NAME,StudentCourse.COURSE_ID 
FROM Student
FULL JOIN StudentCourse 
ON StudentCourse.ROLL_NO = Student.ROLL_NO;
