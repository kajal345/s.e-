CSS
css stands for cascading style sheets
CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.

for example you make one box so you create a structure..so its html but when u design that box it means you draw some pictures on it.or paint it.so its called css
css helps us to make our website more attractive.we can do any type of designing using css.
With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out,
what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more.
Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to yellow, and the text color of the <p> element to pink:

Example
<h1 style="color:yellow;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:pink red paragraph.</p>

Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section\
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. 
In addition, the page will be displayed with a "yellowground color: 

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: yellow
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file


An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading tag</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with .css extension.
body {
  background-color: yellow
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
