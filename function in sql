Function 
SQL has many built-in functions for performing calculations on data.
They are divided into 2 categories: 1. Aggregate Function 2. Scalar Function

 Aggregate Function • These functions are used to do operations from the values of the column and a single value is returned.
 • AVG() - Returns the average value 
 COUNT() - Returns the • number of rows
 FIRST() - Returns the first value 
 • LAST() - Returns the last value 
 MAX() - Returns the largest value
 MIN() - Returns the smallest value 
 SUM() - Returns the sum
 
 1. AVG(): Syntax: SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name; 
 Example: SELECT AVG(AGE) AS AvgAge FROM Students;
 2. COUNT() Syntax: SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
 Example: SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumStudents FROM Stuents;
 3. FIRST() Syntax: SELECT FIRST(column_name) FROM table_name
 Example: SELECT FIRST(MARKS) AS MarksFirst FROM Students;
 
 4. LAST() Syntax: SELECT LAST(column_name) FROM table_name; 
 Example: SELECT LAST(MARKS) AS MarksLast FROM Students; 5.
 MAX() Syntax: SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name; 
 Example :SELECT MAX(MARKS) AS MaxMarks FROM Students; 
 6. MIN(): Similar to Max() we can use MIN() function.
 7. SUM() : Syntax: SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
 Example: SELECT SUM(MARKS) AS TotalMarks FROM Stuents;
