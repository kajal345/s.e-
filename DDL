The Data Definition Language is made up of SQL commands that can be used to design the database structure.
It simply handles database schema descriptions and is used to construct and modify the structure of database objects in the database.

we can create database structure in DDL
DDL refers to a set of SQL instructions for creating, modifying, and deleting database structures, but not data.


in ddl:
commands:
1)create command:-
for create database 

create database database name//in database name we have to give name to database which we want to create

for example i want to create school database then i will write


create database school

now we have to create table for storing data

table is madeup with rows and columns.

create table syntax:
CREATE TABLE table_name(
column1 data_type(size),
column2 data_type(size),
column3 data_type(size),
column4 data_type(size),
â€¦..
);
table_name is the name of a table,
column1 is the name of the first column, 
data_type refers to the type of data that will be stored in this column. For instance, int is used to represent integer data. 
size refers to the maximum amount of data that can be stored in a certain column.

 CREATE TABLE Employee(Emp_Name VARCHAR2(20), DOB DATE, Mobile INT(10), Email VARCHAR2(20));
